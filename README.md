# PolyAI

PolyAI is a AI model designed to play the game PolyTrack.

## Roadmap

- ðŸŸ¡ PolyTrack simulation environment in C++
- ðŸ”´ Optimized C++ simulation environment
- ðŸ”´ Basic PPO model
- ðŸ”´ Distributed training network
- ðŸ”´ Advanced training and hyper-parameter tuning
- TBD...

## Building

Pre-requisites:

- [WASI SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk)
- [Wasm Time](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SpideyZac/polyai.git
    cd polyai
    ```

2. Set your `WASI_SDK` environment variable to point to your WASI SDK installation:

    ```bash
    export WASI_SDK=/path/to/wasi-sdk
    ```

3. Build and run the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

## Intellisense Setup

First, you need to have the `clangd` language server installed as well as the extension for your code editor (e.g., VSCode).

Next, you need to generate the intellisense build configuration using the Makefile:

```bash
make build-intellisense
```

Then, you're ready to use intellisense in your code editor.

## Formatting

This project uses `clang-format` for code formatting. To format the code, run:

```bash
./scripts/format.sh
```
