## Building

Windows is not supported due to WasmTime not being available on Windows. Please use WSL.

Pre-requisites:

- [WASI SDK](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk)
- [Wasm Time](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)

1. Clone the repository with submodules:

    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SpideyZac/polyai.git
    cd polyai
    ```

2. Set your `WASI_SDK` environment variable to point to your WASI SDK installation:

    ```bash
    export WASI_SDK=/path/to/wasi-sdk
    ```

3. Build and run the project:

    ```bash
    make
    ```
